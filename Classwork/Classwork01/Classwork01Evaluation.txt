======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

There is no file header.  You should have at least something!

You don't seem to have indented anything in your code.  This is
not good coding practice.  Pick a consistent number of spaces
[remember, NO TABS] and use that for every indent.

You get 95% out of 100% on this.

======================

Nice job on this assignment...
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

I'm taking it on faith that your PriorityQ and inOrderSearch
submissions are the ones in Mo's repo, since you didn't submit
your own versions.

His version of the traversal only had one test, and I was expecting
at least two, so you lose a point there.  The same can be said for
your two programs of hashing.  There are far too few tests included
here.  The methodology should be to do what you've done with them,
THEN DELETE ALL THE ENTRIES AND DO IT AGAIN WITH DIFFERENT VALUES.
Then, delete THOSE and do it again with a list of the SAME values,
to test the linear probing.  Then, delete ONE of the values, list
the hash table to see it's gone, the delete ANOTHER of the SAME
values and list the hash table to ensure IT is gone.  This checks
the insert and delete to make sure that the linear probing is, in
fact, working the way it's supposed to.

You can NEVER write enough tests....

Kevin, don't be hesitant to compile and run your code.  Don't worry
about getting me to approve it beforehand, just implement your code
the way you've designed it and make it work.  We can always check
out your algorithm and adjust it later [assuming you give yourself
time to do that before it's due] but you'll find that you probably
have a working idea before it ever gets to that point!

You took the menus out of the hashers, so I have to take a couple
of points off for those.

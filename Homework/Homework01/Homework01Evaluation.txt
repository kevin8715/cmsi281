Homework01 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

Your code looks good, but try to be consistent with the
indenting *between* files as well as *within* files so you
show your CRAFT and ART of programming as well as your
technical expertise.  A bit light on the testing -- you
only have one test for "getMax()" and five are required.
Think about including text in the output to reflect what
is expected as well as what the actual result is.

Still, works as advertised.  Keep up the good work!

you got 9.2 out of 10 which is 92% which is an A-minus

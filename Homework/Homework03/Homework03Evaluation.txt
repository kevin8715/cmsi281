Homework03 Evaluation
======================

Interesting work on this assignment!
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

You have a compile error in your oddEvenSort.java file at line
27.  The compiler is barfing on the "curly quotes" in the comment
on that line.  It makes me wonder if you copied this code from
somewhere/someone and forgot to change that?  The code appears
VERY similar to the "ArrayBub.java" file which I saw on a GitHub
repo of solutions for the book's problem sets...  PLEASE be very
careful about this....  Also, the coding style is inconsistent
in this module; be more careful with your indentations!

It would help to add some linefeeds between tests so that the user
can see what is actually going on.  My version from Kevin's repo
put out a looooooooooooooooooooooooong line of numbers, and it was
hard to tell what it was testing and whether it worked.  Try to
break things up logically by test, and output some prompt text to
let the user know what is happening.

I REALLY like the including of sound in the Simon game.  It makes
your version much more like the real thing.  However, the code
you used to backspace and hide the selections didn't work...

Total credit is 13 for Sorter and either Simon or Huffman
 extra credit is 7 points for other of Simon or Huffman
-------------------------
 Grand total is 20 points for all three

you got 11 out of 13 which is 84.62% which is a solid B.
